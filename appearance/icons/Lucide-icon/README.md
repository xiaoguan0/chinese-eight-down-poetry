Lucide Icon is a set of rounded open source icons that are corner-rounded, giving them a more lightweight appearance. By carefully selecting the icon pack, we aim to ensure that the icons accurately convey their functional meaning.

The icon pack is based on the excellent open source icon pack [Lucide icon](https://lucide.dev/) and [table icon](https://tabler-icons.io/). Thank you to the original author for their meticulous design.
